# 💫 About Me:
<br> Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile. As a current student at the University of Borås, I am pursuing a degree in Computer and Systems Science with a focus on Software Development. My academic journey is in its initial stage, but my commitment to mastering the craft of programming is well-established.

Here, you will find a range of projects and assignments that represent my ongoing efforts to develop a robust understanding of software development principles and practices. My approach is methodical and my aim is to build a solid foundation in coding that will support my future growth in the field.

I value the principles of clean code and strive to ensure that my work not only functions effectively but is also maintainable and scalable. While I am at the beginning of my programming journey, I am eager to absorb knowledge, tackle complex problems, and refine my technical skills.

Your interest and feedback on my work are appreciated as they are vital for my progress and learning.
